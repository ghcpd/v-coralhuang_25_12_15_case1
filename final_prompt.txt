## Performance Optimization Task

You are given an existing Python script stored in **`input.py`**, which implements a baseline load test for a model or inference API by sending concurrent HTTP requests and measuring request latency.

Your task is to produce an **enhanced performance testing and optimization solution** that demonstrates:

* **Functional correctness of the testing framework**
* **Measured performance improvement under load, obtained by actually executing the tests**

**You must NOT modify `input.py`.**
All enhancements must be implemented using **new code files**, while preserving compatibility with the baseline approach.

The API endpoint used in `input.py` should be treated as a **placeholder inference endpoint**.

## 1. Existing Behavior (Context)

`input.py` currently:

* Sends concurrent HTTP POST requests
* Uses fixed concurrency and request count
* Measures end-to-end latency per request
* Writes request-level logs to CSV
* Prints latency percentiles (P50 / P95 / P99)

This represents the **pre-optimization (Before)** state.
