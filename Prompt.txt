## Performance Optimization Task

You are given an existing Python script stored in **`input.py`**, which implements a baseline load test for a model or inference API by sending concurrent HTTP requests and measuring request latency.

Your task is to produce an **enhanced performance testing and optimization solution** that demonstrates:

* **Functional correctness of the testing framework**
* **Measured performance improvement under load, obtained by actually executing the tests**

**You must NOT modify `input.py`.**
All enhancements must be implemented using **new code files**, while preserving compatibility with the baseline approach.

The API endpoint used in `input.py` should be treated as a **placeholder inference endpoint**.

---

## 1. Existing Behavior (Context)

`input.py` currently:

* Sends concurrent HTTP POST requests
* Uses fixed concurrency and request count
* Measures end-to-end latency per request
* Writes request-level logs to CSV
* Prints latency percentiles (P50 / P95 / P99)

This represents the **pre-optimization (Before)** state.

---

## 2. Optimization Goal

A performance regression has been observed:

* SLA requirement: **P95 latency ≤ 800 ms**
* Baseline P95 latency exceeds this threshold

Your solution must reduce latency **without degrading output quality**.

---

## 3. Required Work

### 3.1 Baseline Preservation

* Preserve baseline behavior and reproducibility
* Use identical inputs, load parameters, and request semantics for all comparisons

---

### 3.2 Functional Verification (Correctness)

You must include **functional verification tests** to ensure the testing framework itself is correct.

At minimum, verify:

* Request inputs are logically identical between Before and After runs
* Per-request logs are generated and contain required fields
* Percentile calculations are correct for known datasets
* SLA gating is enforced correctly (pass/fail behavior)

Functional tests **must be deterministic** and **must not depend on a live external service**.
You may use a local stub or simulated service.

**These functional verification tests must be executed as part of the final solution, not only described.**

---

### 3.3 Performance Analysis

* Analyze baseline latency results using measured data
* Identify likely contributors to high latency
* Do not rely on assumptions without evidence

---

### 3.4 Optimization Implementation

* Implement at least one concrete optimization
* Examples include (but are not limited to):

  * Improved concurrency or connection handling
  * Client-side batching (if applicable)
  * Clear separation of baseline vs optimized phases

Explain **why** the optimization should reduce latency.

---

### 3.5 Post-Optimization Performance Test

* Re-run the same load test after optimization
* Conditions must match the baseline
* Collect request-level latency logs

**The performance test must be actually executed, and results must come from real runs of the implemented code.**

---

### 3.6 Timing Comparison

Produce a **Before vs After comparison** including:

* P50 / P95 / P99 latency
* Total request count
* Successful vs failed requests

Results must be based on **real measured data generated by executing the test code**, not hypothetical or estimated values.

---

## 4. Output Requirements

### 4.1 Enhanced Implementation (New Code Only)

Your solution must:

* Leave `input.py` unchanged
* Include functional verification tests
* Include performance tests (Before + After)
* Produce machine-readable logs and comparison output

You must provide an executable script named **`run_tests`** that:

* Executes all functional verification tests
* Executes baseline and post-optimization performance tests
* Generates comparison artifacts (CSV or JSON) from the actual runs
* Exits with a non-zero status code if the SLA is not met after optimization

**The final results reported must correspond to an actual execution of `run_tests`.**

---

### 4.2 Documentation (`README`)

Provide a README that explains:

* Optimization approach
* Environment setup
* How to run `run_tests`
* What tests are executed
* How results are generated
* Whether the SLA is met based on real execution
* Assumptions or limitations

---

## 5. Constraints

* The API endpoint is a placeholder
* Test conditions must remain consistent
* Do not reduce output quality to achieve latency gains
* All conclusions must be supported by **data produced by executed tests**

---

## 6. Final Deliverables

1. **Enhanced testing implementation (new code)** with executable `run_tests`
2. **README documentation**
